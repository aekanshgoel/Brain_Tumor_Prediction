# Brain Tumor Prediction
Brain Tumors are complex. There are a lot of abnormalities in the sizes and location of the brain tumor(s). This makes it really difficult for complete understanding of the nature of the tumor. Also, a professional Neurosurgeon is required for MRI analysis. Often times in developing countries the lack of skillful doctors and lack of knowledge about tumors makes it really challenging and time-consuming to generate reports from MRIâ€™. So an automated system on Cloud can solve this problem.

## Goal
To Detect and Classify Brain Tumor using, CNN or ANN; as an asset of Deep Learning and to examine the tumor position(segmentation).

# Dataset Information

The dataset contains 3 folders: yes, no and pred which contains 3060 Brain MRI Images.
